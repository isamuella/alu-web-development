# Adding CSS to my simple HTML Webpage.

Welcome back to my simple guide through the basics of creating a webpage using HTML only but inspired by a designer file. This time we are adding CSS to the webpage to make it more bautiful. Let's get started!


## Design my HTML

### Steps to add css styling to my functional HTML Webpage:

1. **Creating a CSS file**:
   I will begin by creating a CSS file and in the same directory add my previous HTML file.

2. **Linking my CSS file to the HTML file**:
   I will have to add a link to my CSS file using the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section of my HTML file.

## Styling the HTML Elements:
Now let's get to see how to style the HTML elements in detail:

1. **Selectors**:
   I will use selectors in CSS file to target the HTML elements. For example to style `<h1>` i will use `h1 {}`

2. **Colors**:
   I will use different colors to make my webpage visually apealing. I will use `background-color`, `color`, and `border` properties.

3. **Layout**:
   I wil use properties like `margin`, `padding`, etc to control the layout.

4. **Typography**:
   I will use properties like `font-size`, `text-align`, etc to style the text in my liking.

## Concluding
With these steps i will use CSS to create better styling of my existing HTML that is functional and organized. This will work well to make the simple design into a more advanced webpage.
