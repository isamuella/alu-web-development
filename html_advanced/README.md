# Building a simple HTML Webpage.

Welcome to my simple guide through the basics of creating a webpage using HTML only but inspired by a designer file. Let's get started!


## From Design to HTML

### Steps to create a functional HTML Webpage:

1. **Structuring the HTML**:
   I will begin by using HTML elements, tags, and attributes for the structure to flow.

2. **Adding Content**:
   I will have to add images, texts, and other elements provided in the design like `<img>` for images, `<p>` for text writing, etc.

3. **Creating Links**:
   I will use `<a>` to get to use links easily and navigate menus.


## Concluding
With these steps i will use HTML to create a functional and organized webpage. This will work well to make a simple design but it will be much better when the use of CSS and JavaScript comes in. But today we will just use HTML and see what comes out of it.
